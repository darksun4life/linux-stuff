	In an era before time, filled with great evil and dangers, our hero PLAYER starts his quest in the pursuit of his love, Catherine.
	They say, that if you have seen Babylon but not Arkala, you have seen nothing. Located near the shores of the Nebula Sea, the city has soon blossomed into a majestic metropole. Having the largest port in the Eastern world, many shady characters found their way inside the city walls.

	Life was simple but hard, in the great town, and everyone was doing their fair share.

	As the sun descends over the water, and nightfall engulfs the land, our hero is eagerly waiting to meet Catherine Blake.

	 "The wild winds weep,
	  And the night is a-cold;
	  Come hither, Sleep,
	  And my grief unfold:
	  But lo, the morning peeps
	  Over the eastern steeps,
	  And the rustling beds of dawn
	  The earth do scorn."

				Quote from "Mad Song", by W. Blake

	As a new dawn rises, the warmth of the sun wakes our sleeping hero, PLAYER from a troubling dream. He realizes that Catherine never came, and starts looking for her at her parents house. Approaching the cottage he sees smoke rising to the sky. Panicking, he runs to the house, only to find the charred remains of Catherine's parents.

	Searching through the rubble for other bodies, he remembers that Catherine had a brother, in a near village, Beggar's Hole.

	Not knowing how to get there, his only hope is the old cartographer in the town. He hurries to the Cartographer's Shop and asks the old man for a map to Beggar's Hole. Not having any money, he agrees to do a service in exchange for the map.

	The cartographer, being old, asks PLAYER to fetch him some EREMUS plants, that grow in the forest near town. The tea made from the plants will relieve his dying wife's pain.
